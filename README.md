# ZTS Trading Simulator
This is the repository for the Zurich Trading Simulator (ZTS) a web-based behavior experiment 
in the form of a trading game, designed by the Chair of Cognitive Science - ETH Zurich. 
It is developed using oTree an open-source platform for behavioral research.

For a more detailed documentation read [here](./documentation.pdf).

## Project Structure
- The entire Project is developed in Otree built upon Django. Any requirements that are not supported in Otree are built directly in Django.
- Javascript and CSS Files are stored in `_static/` as suggested by [Otree Documentation](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- An Otree session (The entire ZTS experiment) contains several sub-sessions:
    - `/ZTS`: x rounds of the trading simulator, where the number of rounds x can be set in the `ZTS/models.py`.
    - `/Post_Survey`: A link to a post survey, specified through the session settings.  
- Timeseries Files used for the trading charts are stored in the following way: 
    `/_static/ZTS/timeseries_files/[filename]_[round-nr].csv` make sure that if replacing them, they are in the same format.
- Reports: Download the custom Report for a more detailed trading actions summary.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Make sure to use `python 3.7` if possible to avoid any problems with Otree.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

1. clone the repository to your local machine
2. cd to the project directory
3. create a new python environment: `python3 -m venv env_name`
4. activate your virtualenv source: `bin/activate`
5. install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements_base.txt`
6. run the developement server: `otree devserver`

## Built With
